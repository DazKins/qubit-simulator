# Qubit Simulator

This is the source code for a 1 qubit quantum circuit simulator.

It is currently hosted here: https://dazkins.com/qubitSimulator.

_Note that there is no official/automated release workflow for this, it's just me manually copy/pasting the JS/HTML files, so it's possible there could be divergence between the code in this repo and what's on the live version_

## Building and running

The project is mostly written in raw HTML and JS but Vite has been included with NodeJS to make the linking of the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) dependency easier.

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
